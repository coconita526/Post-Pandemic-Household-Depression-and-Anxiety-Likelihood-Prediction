# Household Mental Health Capstone Project

## Part 1 Project Overview
In an era marked by the rising prevalence of anxiety and depression, the healthcare sector faces the daunting task of addressing mental health concerns among its patients and professionals. Recent global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread unemployment, and economic uncertainty, have further magnified these challenges. 
What's often overlooked is the profound influence of household aspects on individual mental well-being.   

This Capstone project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at illuminating the intricate relationship between household factors and mental health within the healthcare sector. It seeks to answer a fundamental question: How do demographic variables, financial status, employment dynamics, childcare availability, medical resources, inflation rates, 
food supply, and vaccination records affect the mental well-being of individuals? 

At its core, this project represents an exploration into the uncharted territory of mental health data science. It is a multi-faceted endeavor encompassing data collection, integration, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and actionable insights. Through advanced data analysis and modeling, it aspires to predict mental health outcomes 
and provide early diagnoses, targeted interventions, and a comprehensive understanding of mental health within the healthcare sector.

The impact of this project reaches far beyond the realm of data analysis. It seeks to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health, improve accessibility to mental health resources, and predict outcomes for the betterment of mental well-being. Ultimately, this project aspires to empower healthcare providers, policymakers, and individuals with 
the tools and knowledge needed to foster a healthier, more resilient society.

### 1.1 Area of Interest
The primary area of interest of this Capstone project is to investigate the intricate relationship between various household factors and individuals' mental health status within the healthcare sector. We aim to explore how 
demographic factors, financial status, employment status, childcare availability, medical availability, inflation, food supply, vaccination, and other related aspects impact mental well-being. Each of these aspects will be 
dissected into detailed features to enable a deeper exploration. Furthermore, this comprehensive analysis will serve as the foundation for the development of machine learning models, aiming to predict mental health outcomes 
and provide valuable insights for early diagnoses and targeted interventions.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of anxiety and depression within households. By analyzing a range of household-specific factors, including demographics, financial status, employment, childcare, healthcare 
accessibility, and other related aspects, the goal is to develop machine learning models that can accurately forecast the likelihood of anxiety and depression in household members. These predictive models will provide valuable 
insights for early detection and targeted interventions, ultimately improving the overall mental well-being of households.
