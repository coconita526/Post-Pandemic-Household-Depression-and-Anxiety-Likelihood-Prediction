# Household Anxiety and Depression Likelihood Prediction 

</div>

## ðŸ“Œ Part 1 Project Overview
In an era marked by the rising prevalence of anxiety and depression, the healthcare sector faces the daunting task of addressing mental health concerns among its patients and professionals. Recent global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread unemployment, and economic uncertainty, have further magnified these challenges. 
What's often overlooked is the profound influence of household aspects on individual mental well-being.   

This Capstone project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at illuminating the intricate relationship between household factors and mental health within the healthcare sector. It seeks to answer a fundamental question: How do demographic variables, financial status, employment dynamics, childcare availability, medical resources, inflation rates, 
food supply, and vaccination records affect the mental well-being of individuals? 

At its core, this project represents an exploration into the uncharted territory of mental health data science. It is a multi-faceted endeavor encompassing data collection, integration, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and actionable insights. Through advanced data analysis and modeling, it aspires to predict mental health outcomes 
and provide early diagnoses, targeted interventions, and a comprehensive understanding of mental health within the healthcare sector.

The impact of this project reaches far beyond the realm of data analysis. It seeks to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health, improve accessibility to mental health resources, and predict outcomes for the betterment of mental well-being. Ultimately, this project aspires to empower healthcare providers, policymakers, and individuals with 
the tools and knowledge needed to foster a healthier, more resilient society.

### ðŸŽ¯ 1.1 Area of Interest
The primary area of interest of this Capstone project is to investigate the intricate relationship between various household factors and individuals' mental health status within the healthcare sector. We aim to explore how 
demographic factors, financial status, employment status, childcare availability, medical availability, inflation, food supply, vaccination, and other related aspects impact mental well-being. Each of these aspects will be 
dissected into detailed features to enable a deeper exploration. Furthermore, this comprehensive analysis will serve as the foundation for the development of machine learning models, aiming to predict mental health outcomes 
and provide valuable insights for early diagnoses and targeted interventions.

### ðŸš‘ 1.2 Problem Statement

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of anxiety and depression within households. By analyzing a range of household-specific factors, including demographics, financial status, employment, childcare, healthcare 
accessibility, and other related aspects, the goal is to develop machine learning models that can accurately forecast the likelihood of anxiety and depression in household members. These predictive models will provide valuable 
insights for early detection and targeted interventions, ultimately improving the overall mental well-being of households.

### ðŸŽ‰ 1.3 Impacts

The findings of this project hold the potential to make a significant positive impact on both individuals and society at large. By uncovering the intricate web of factors that contribute to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), we are in a position to initiate targeted interventions and support systems. The societal and business values that this project can add are multifold. Firstly, addressing mental health issues proactively can lead to a reduction in lost productivity, saving businesses and organizations millions of dollars in healthcare expenditures and productivity losses. Early detection of mental health issues can also translate into substantial cost savings for individuals and healthcare systems. Moreover, the project's insights are integral in promoting healthier, more resilient communities, fostering improved quality of life for individuals and their families. Overall, this research offers a roadmap for more effective mental health strategies, both at the individual and societal levels, with far-reaching implications for the well-being and productivity of our society.

### ðŸ“Š 1.5 Dataset Description

The dataset utilized for this research was sourced from cdc.gov and originates from the collaborative efforts of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the U.S. Census Bureau, known as the Household Pulse Survey. This ongoing survey, in its latest phase, Phase 3.10 (August 23 - September 4), is specifically designed to collect crucial data on the social and economic ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic on households within the United States. 

To provide accurate and timely weekly estimates, the survey employs an internet-based questionnaire distributed via email and text messages. The dataset draws its sample frame from the Census Bureau Master Address File Data, with randomly selected housing units linked to email addresses or cell phone numbers, and one respondent selected from each housing unit.

In addition to exploring the socio-economic impacts, the survey integrates questions regarding mental health, using a modified version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) scale to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms within the U.S. population. This dataset, originating from a robust and systematic survey, provides a wealth of information that serves as the foundation for our research into the mental health implications of the pandemic.
